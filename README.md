# DAM Project

This repository contains the Digital Asset Management (DAM) system for our semester project, where the entire class collaborates to build a complete webshop system. Our team is responsible for developing the DAM component.

## Project Overview

The DAM is built using Avalonia for the frontend and a .NET web application for the backend. It is designed to handle and process incoming requests from other parts of the system.

## Important Information

If you are a member of one of the other teams in this semester project, please refer to the  [wiki page](https://github.com/Nico170f/sdu-semesterproject-dam/wiki) for relevant documentation and integration details.

If you are not part of this semester project, this repository is likely of little use to you, as it is developed for a specific course assignment and lacks general-purpose documentation.
